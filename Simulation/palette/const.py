    You can set ROUND > 1 to generate diverse anonymity sets.
    Specifically, each website can be assigned to ROUND anonymity sets, to ensure different visits to the same
    website can exhibit diverse traffic patterns.  
    In this work, we simply set ROUND = 1, i.e., each website is assigned to a single anonymity set.
